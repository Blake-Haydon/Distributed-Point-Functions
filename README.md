# Distributed Point Functions

> **Warning**
> DO NOT USE ANY OF THIS CODE IN PRODUCTION

Python notebooks on distributed point functions.
The notebooks are experiments for my own learning and understanding the topic.
The notebooks are not meant to be used in real systems.

The notebooks are based on the following paper ["Distributed Point Functions and Their Applications"](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-642-55220-5_35.pdf)

0. [Trivial 1 bit DPF with private set inclusion lookup](0_trivial_single_bit_DPF.ipynb)
1. [Trivial n bit DPF with private information retrieval](1_trivial_multi_bit_DPF.ipynb) (contains code for $DPF_0$)
