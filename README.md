# Distributed Point Functions

Python notebooks on distributed point functions. The notebooks are experiments for my own learning and understanding the topic.

### **Notebooks**

The notebooks are based on the following paper ["Distributed Point Functions and Their Applications"](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-642-55220-5_35.pdf)

- [Naive DPF](naive_DPF.py) Examples
  - [Single Bit Point Function](naive_DPF_single_bit.ipynb)
  - [Multiple Bit Point Function](naive_DPF_multiple_bit.ipynb)
  - [Private Set Inclusion](naive_DPF_set_inclusion.ipynb)
  - [Private Database Read](naive_DPF_private_read.ipynb)
